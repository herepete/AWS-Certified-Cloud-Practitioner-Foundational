What is AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification?
Amazon has several AWS cloud certification pathways. The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification is an entry-level certification that is intended to demonstrate a basic level of knowledge and skills of Amazon AWS cloud. This exam is suitable for those in technical, managerial and sales roles.

To achieve the certification you must pass a single exam. Amazon recommends that you have at least 6 months of experience before sitting the exam. I had no prior experience with Amazon AWS prior to studying for the exam. I did, however, have experience with Microsoft Azure cloud services.

The Certified Cloud Practitioner certification page provides links to various study resources including AWS whitepapers, links to booking the exam, sample test questions etc.

Content covered in the exam is as follows:

Domain 1: Cloud Concepts
1. Define the AWS Cloud and its value proposition
2. Identify aspects of AWS Cloud economics
3. List the different cloud architecture design principles

Domain 2: Security
1. Define the AWS Shared Responsibility model
2. Define AWS Cloud security and compliance concepts
3. Identify AWS access management capabilities
4. Identify resources for security support

Domain 3: Technology
1. Define methods of deploying and operating in the AWS Cloud
2. Define the AWS global infrastructure
2. Identify the core AWS services
4. Identify resources for technology support

Domain 4: Billing and Pricing
1. Compare and contrast the various pricing models for AWS
2. Recognise the various account structures in relation to AWS billing and pricing
3. Identify resources available for billing support

The exam is largely high level and provides a basic overview of AWS core offerings, security, pricing, and support services. You don't need any in-depth knowledge of AWS  to pass the exam. You just need to have a basic awareness of the various AWS service offerings and understand the pricing and support model.
